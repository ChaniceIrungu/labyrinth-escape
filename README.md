# Labyrinth Shortest Path

This project implements a labyrinth solver that finds the shortest path from a start point ('S') to an end point ('E') in a given grid, where walls are represented by '1' and open paths by '0'. The program validates user input, constructs the labyrinth, and then uses a breadth-first search algorithm to determine the shortest path, returning the length of the path or -1 if no path exists
